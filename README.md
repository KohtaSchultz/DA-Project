# DA-Project
I'll put things from my Data Analytics Career Accel Studio project here.
# Stage 1 - Discovery
"Assess the available resources":
  Both Kaggle and Analytics Hub on BigQuery have datasets put together.
"Frame the problem" (Describe the problem in my own words)
"Develop initial hypothesis"
"Identify potential data sources"
"Consider data ethics"
# Stage 2 - Data Preparation
"Learn about the data, check for gaps, and identify datasets that may be useful"
"Identify the data inputs for analysis and perform the migration"
"Prepare data for analysis - Clean data, normalize datasets"
# Stage 3 - Data Analysis
"Compare different models for the analysis"
"Identify models/techniques/tools to analyze the data"
"Ensure the analytical techniques will meet the project requirements"
"Execute the data analysis using models/techniques/tools identified"
# Stage 4 - Result Communication
"Create a set of presentation slides and insert graphical representations to show the results of the data analysis"
Present the project
